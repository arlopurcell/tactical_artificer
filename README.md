# Plot Notes
A party of a (non-magical) smith, clothier, jeweler, and maybe one more shipwreck on an island. They find magic materials and make cool magic stuff out of them. They find a dead portal that can send them home, but it needs to be powered up with 3(?) magic artifacts. They adventure to find them.
